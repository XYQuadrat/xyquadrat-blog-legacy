### In which subjects am I allowed to bring cheathsheets?

You may bring a handwritten (that is, either on paper or digitally with a tablet) cheatsheet of TODO pages in Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra. For Algorithms & Datastructures and Introduction to Programming, no cheatsheet is allowed.

### I haven't started writing my cheatsheets yet. Am I in trouble?
If you're reading this before New Year's Eve, no. Writing the cheatsheets takes quite a lot of time, especially in Discrete Mathematics. But since it can also serve as a repetition, you should be fine - the majority of students only starts writing cheatsheets in Lernphase. Don't begin writing just the week before the exams though!

### Can I copy another cheatsheet and save some time?
(TODO check what is allowed)

### How much should I study per day in Lernphase?
An exact number of hours is hard to give, since the level of knowledge of students varies widely. Instead, the author prefers to give an upper bound: He believes that studying more than 6 hours a day is a bad idea; for the following reasons:
- The Lernphase is quite long. Overworking yourself will likely lead to a burnout.
- It is much more effective to distribute your study time over multiple days than to cram more on a single day.
- Very few students can learn in a concentrated, focused way for 6h (that means no distractions, no daydreaming, etc.). If you are such a student, you really don't need any of my advice.

### Do I need to study every day?
**No.** Quite the opposite - do not study every day, take a day per week off! Try to relax as much as possible on that day, so that you can recharge your batteries and be ready for another week of studying.

### Should I rewatch all lectures?
That's a bad idea. It will take up a lot of time and you will probably not benefit that much.

### Okay, what should I do then instead?
(This is only one of multiple possible approaches.) Focus on solving old exams. You can find lots of them on [exams.vis.ethz.ch](https://exams.vis.ethz.ch). When you realize you can't solve an exam task because you just don't understand the topic, reread the script and/or rewatch the relevant lecture. In addition, try re-solving the exercises from that topic.

If you're stuck, ask for help, in the respective Discord channel, in your study group if you have one or mail your TA. On the other hand, if you feel comfortable in a subject, try answering these questions. Being able to explain content to others means you really understood it.

### What should I do on the day of the exam?
Relax. You won't suddenly learn everything you didn't have time to understand on the day of the exam. Go to sleep early the day before; being well rested is crucial for delivering your best possible performance.
